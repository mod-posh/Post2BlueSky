# BlueSky Notification GitHub Action

## Overview

The "Post2Bluesky" Github Action posts a message to your Bsky social account. You can use this for project update notifications, new releases, or just an easy way to post a message. The workflow accepts a plain-text message or a JSON string comprised of at least [bsky record](https://atproto.com/blog/create-post#post-record-structure).

## Setup

**GitHub Secrets**: Set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `bluesky_api_key`: Your BlueSky App Password.
- `bluesky_identifier`: Your BlueSky Identifier, like `user.bsky.social`.

## Workflow File

You can invoke the `action.yml` from a workflow step to post a notification automatically. The action contains a single step to act:

1. Call the `post2bsky.ps1` script

### Workflow Inputs

- `Message`: The message to post, for links use github [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)
- `verbose`: A value of verbose will output additional information
- `bluesky_api_key`: Your BlueSky App Password
- `bluesky_identifier`: Your BlueSky Identifier, something like user.bsky.social

## PowerShell Script (`post2bsky.ps1`)

The PowerShell script constructs an authentication package to authenticate into the API. Once it has authenticated, it checks to see if the `Message` is a proper bsky record with repo or if it's a plain-text message. If it's a proper message it is posted; if it's missing a repo, one is constructed, and then the message is posted; and finally, if it's just a plain-text message, a record and repo are created and posted for you.

## Usage

There a few different ways you could use this action, here is an example of one way to get you started.

```yaml
jobs:
  send_notification:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mod-posh/Post2BlueSky@v0.0.3.1
        with:
          message: '"This is a test post with a link to [github](https://www.github.com)"'
          verbose: 'verbose'
          bluesky_api_key: ${{ secrets.bluesky_api_key }}
          bluesky_identifier: ${{ secrets.bluesky_identifier }}
```

> [!Note]
> This example is used directly as part of a larger workflow
> The verbose option will output a little more detail in the logs
